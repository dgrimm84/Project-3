** In our project on the national parks in the USA, which featured a 3D Earth model, we prioritized ethical considerations by exclusively using free and publicly available information. All data and resources were sourced from reputable platforms that allow public use, ensuring compliance with copyright and licensing terms. We credited these sources appropriately and adhered to their usage guidelines. Our approach ensured transparency, accessibility, and respect for intellectual property, while presenting accurate and unbiased information about the natural and cultural significance of national parks. This ethical framework allowed us to create a project that is both informative and respectful of the sources and audiences involved.
